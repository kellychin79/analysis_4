# Vehicle Routing Workbook

This is a playbook for exercising above questions.

## From Point to Point 

- How to display an area graph which consists of nodes (intersection) and edges (paths)?

- How to identify a node closest to a specific location?

- How to find the shortest route between locations?

- How to figure out the best route in terms of travel time or travel distance?

## From The Route Perspective

According to Wikipedia, 

> The vehicle routing problem is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?"
